This package aims to provide developer with an easy way to scaffhold their API
using a JWT Keychain.

**ATTENTION:** This is a very raw experiment that needs to be tested and validated.

## Demo project
https://github.com/nodes-vapor/jwt-keychain-demo

## Installation

Update your `Package.swift` file.
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/jwt-keychain.git", majorVersion: 0)
```

Create config jwt.json with:

signer[HS256, HS384, HS512] + secondsToExpire + signatureKey

or

signer[ES256, ES384, ES512, RS256, RS384, RS512] + secondsToExpire + signatureKey + publicKey

Create config `jwt.json`
```json
{
    "signer": "HS256",
    "secondsToExpire": 3600,
    "signatureKey": "our-little-secret"
}
```
See https://github.com/siemensikkema/vapor-jwt to know more about signing

Import the module whenever needed:

```swift
import JWTKeychain
```

## Getting started üöÄ

### Minimal setup

Register user routes

```swift
drop.collection(UserRoutes(drop: drop))
```

That's it, now you'll have the following routes out-of-the-box:

- Login: `POST /users/login`
- Register: `POST /users`
- Logout: `GET /users/logout`
- Token regenerate: `PATCH /users/token/regenerate`
- Me: `GET /users/me`

### Customized setup

If you want to roll out your own routes or have more control of the controller logic, you can initialize the routes like this:

```swift
let configuration = try JWTKeychain.Configuration(drop: drop)
let jwtAuthMiddleware = JWTKeychain.AuthMiddleware(configuration: configuration)
let authMiddleware = Auth.AuthMiddleware<MyCustomUser>()
let protectMiddleWare = ProtectMiddleware(
    error: Abort.custom(
        status: .unauthorized,
        message: Status.unauthorized.reasonPhrase
    )
)
let userController = MyUserController(configuration: configuration)

try drop.collection(UserRoutes(
    drop: drop,
    configuration: configuration,
    jwtAuthMiddleware: jwtAuthMiddleware,
    authMiddleware: authMiddleware,
    protectMiddleware: protectMiddleWare,
    userController: userController
))
```

Most of the parameters has default values, so feel free to mix and match as needed.


The aim is to encode the user identifier on the SubjectClaim of the JWT. This way we don't
need to keep track of the user's tokens on the database. The tokens generated are signed by
the key setup on the config file.

We just need to verify the token signature and its claims.
