Add a complete and customizable user authentication system for your API project.

## Demo project

https://github.com/nodes-vapor/jwt-keychain-demo

## üì¶ Installation

Update your `Package.swift` file.

### Swift 3

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/jwt-keychain.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 13)
```

### Swift 4

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/jwt-keychain.git", upToMajorVersion: "1.0.0")
```
```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "App",
        dependencies: [
            ...
            "JWTKeychain"
        ]
    ),
    ...
]
```

## Getting started üöÄ

### Configuration

Create config `jwt.json` (for more information, see [JWTProvider](https://github.com/vapor/jwt-provider).

```json
{
	"signers": {
		"access": {
			"type": "hmac",
			"algorithm": "hs256",
			"key": "yourkeyhere"
		},
		"refresh": {
			"type": "hmac",
			"algorithm": "hs256",
			"key": "yourkeyhere"
		},
		"reset": {
			"type": "hmac",
			"algorithm": "hs256",
			"key": "yourkeyhere"
		}
	}
}
```

Create config `jwt-keychain.json`.

```json
{
	"apiAccess": {
		"kid": "access",
		"secondsToExpire": 3600,
	},
	"refreshToken": {
		"kid": "refresh",
		"secondsToExpire": 31536000
	},
	"resetPassword": {
		"kid": "reset",
		"secondsToExpire": 3600
	},

	"fromAddress": "sender@email.com",
	"fromName": "Name of Sender",

	"pathToEmailView": "JWTKeychain/Emails/resetPassword",
	"pathToFormView": "JWTKeychain/ResetPassword/resetPassword",

	"apiPathPrefix": "api/users",
	"frontendPathPrefix": "users/reset-password",

	"bCryptCost": 6
}
```

The `kid` (key ID) values should correspond to values in `jwt.json`. The above values for `apiAccess` and `resetPassword` are the defaults used when no configuration is supplied.

Usage of a refresh token is optional. You can opt out of using the refresh token by removing the `refreshToken` key.

The cost for the BCrypt hasher can be configured using `bCryptCost`. This is separate from the default hasher used by the droplet. A cost of 6 is the default. A higher cost is more secure but adds significant response time to your requests (eg. a value of 10 can mean response times of several seconds).

The only required fields are `fromName` and `fromAddress`. They determine the name and email address that recipients of password reset emails will see.

JWTKeychainProvider uses the default mailer as configured in `mail.json` or `mailgun.json`
 for sending password reset emails.

Make sure a value for the key `url` is provided in `app.json`. This will be used to generate the link in the password reset email.

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

JWTKeychain uses Leaf to render the password reset email and form. Make sure Leaf is set up by adding `"view": "leaf"` to `droplet.json` and add the LeafProvider:

```swift
try addProvider(LeafProvider.Provider.self)
```

### Resources

Copy package resources:

Move the content of `JWTKeychain/Resources/Views` into the `Resources/Views` folder of your project. Unfortunately there's no convenient to this at the moment, but one option is to download this repo as a zip and then move the folders into the root of your project. Remember to check that you're not overwriting any files in your project.

See `https://github.com/vapor/vapor-jwt` to learn more about signing.

### Usage

Add the provider (preferably in `setupProviders()` in `Config+Setup.swift`):

```swift
import JWTKeychain
```

```swift
try addProvider(JWTKeychain.Provider<JWTKeychain.User>.self)
```

That's it! Now, you'll have the following routes out-of-the-box:

- Login: `POST /users/login`
- Register: `POST /users`
- Logout: `GET /users/logout`
- Token regenerate: `PATCH /users/token/regenerate`
- Me: `GET /users/me`
- Reset password: `POST /users/reset-password/request`

### Token Generator Command
In order to generate password reset tokens for users add the following to `droplet.json`'s `commands`: `"keychain:generate_token"`. Then you can create a token like so:

> `drop --run keychain:generate_token user@email.com`

## Tokens
There are three types of tokens used by JWTKeychain: refresh tokens, API access tokens, and password reset tokens.

Both refresh and access tokens should be included in the `Authorization` header for each request they are needed for, as follows: `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` (where `TOKEN` is replaced with the actual token string).

### Refresh Tokens

> Usage of this type of token is optional but recommended for extra security. You can opt-out of using refresh tokens by omitting the value for `refreshToken` in `jwt-keychain.json`.

Refresh tokens are tokens with a long expiration time that can be used to generate the more short-lived access tokens that are needed for API access.

Refresh tokens are returned when logging in and when signing up* as a string under the key: `refreshToken`. They can only be used to create new access tokens at the `/users/regenerate` endpoint.

When a refresh token expires a new one can be generated by logging in using the user's credentials.

\* Besides the refresh token, an access token and the user object are also returned as a convenience to the client developer.

### API Access Tokens

API Access tokens give access to the following endpoints:
* GET `/users/me`
* GET `/users/logout`
* PATCH `/users/update`

as well as the endpoints

Whenever an access token is expired a new one can be generated using a request to `/users/regenerate`.

### Password Reset Tokens

## Customization

Besides using configuration there are several more ways to customize JWTKeychain's behavior.

### User Type

You can substitute the provided User type for your own by making your user conform to `JWTKeychainUser` which is composed of the following protocols:

```swift
public typealias JWTKeychainUser =
    EmailAddressRepresentable &
    Entity &
    JSONRepresentable &
    JWTKeychainAuthenticatable &
    NodeRepresentable &
    PasswordAuthenticatable &
    PasswordUpdateable &
    PayloadAuthenticatable &
    Preparation
```

```swift
class CustomUser: JWTKeychainUser {
	...
}
```

An easy way to get started is to copy the existing User implementation to your project and adjust where necessary.

Substitute the provided User type with your own when adding the provider.

```swift
try addProvider(JWTKeychain.Provider<CustomUser>.self)
```

### API Requests

```swift
public protocol APIUserControllerDelegateType {
    func register(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func logIn(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func logOut(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func regenerate(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func me(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func resetPasswordEmail(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators,
        passwordResetMailer: PasswordResetMailerType
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func update(
        request: Request,
        tokenGenerators: TokenGenerators
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable
}
```

```swift
class CustomAPIDelegate: APIUserControllerDelegateType {
	...
}
```

```swift
try addProvider(JWTKeychain.Provider<CustomUser>(
	apiDelegate: CustomAPIDelegate()),
	settings: Settings(config: config)
)
```

### Frontend Requests

```swift
public protocol FrontendUserControllerDelegateType {
    func resetPasswordForm(
        request: Request,
        token: String,
        verifiedJWT: JWT,
        viewRenderer: ViewRenderer
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func resetPasswordChange(
        request: Request,
        verifiedJWT: JWT,
        formPath: String
    ) throws -> ResponseRepresentable

    func handleInvalidJWT(
        request: Request,
        token: String,
        jwtError: JWTError,
        formPath: String
    ) -> ResponseRepresentable
}
```

```swift
class CustomFrontendDelegate: FrontendUserControllerDelegateType {
	...
}
```

```swift
try addProvider(JWTKeychain.Provider<CustomUser>(
	frontendDelegate: CustomFrontendDelegate()),
	settings: Settings(config: config)
)
```

### Supply Additional Middleware

```swift
try addProvider(JWTKeychain.Provider<CustomUser>(
	apiMiddleware: [...],
	frontendMiddleware: [...],
	settings: Settings(config: config)
)
```
